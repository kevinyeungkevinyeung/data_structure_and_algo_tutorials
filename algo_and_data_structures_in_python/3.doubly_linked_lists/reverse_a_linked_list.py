How to reverse a linked list

    the tasks is to construct a in-place algorithm to reverse a singly linked list

    1. Naive solution
        We consider all the nodes one by one then construct another linked list in reverse order

        problem: it has O(N) memory complexity so it is not in-place

    2. using pointers
        we can achieve an in-place algo that has O(N) linear running time complexity as well
