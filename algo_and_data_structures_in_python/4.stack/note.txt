### What are stacks?

    it is an abstract data types

    it has a so-call LIFO (last in first out) structure - the last item we insert is the first item we take out

    basic operations are pop(), push() and peek()

    most of the modern programming languates are stack-oriented

    they define most basic operations (adding two numbers) as taking their arguments from the stack and placing any return values back to a stack

### Stack Memory

    stack memory is a special region in the RAM (random access memory)

    this is a special data type (stack) taht stores local variables and method calls

    this is how the programming language know where to return after finish execution of a given method

    it is small in size but fast to access
    
    no fragmentation

### Heap memory
    heap memory is a special region in the RAM where dynamic memory allocation takes place

    the size of the heap is way larger than the size of the stack memory

    objects (reference types) are stored on the heap memory

    it is large in size but slow to access

    fragmentation

    we can have a heap memory overflow if we allocate memory without deallcoating previously allocated memory space
    or if we allocate an extremely large number of objets

    stack memory   
        is extremely crucial in every operating system to store the function calls and local variables
